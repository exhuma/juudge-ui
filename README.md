# Juudge UI

A simple web-ui for the "juudge" MTG assistant API


The project is built using VueJS and Vuetify. To set up an environment, simply
run:

```
npm clean-install
```

Before running, you must create an application config in `public/config.json`.
Use `sample-files/config.json` as a template.


Then, to run the dev-environment, run

```
npm run dev
```

## Dev Container

The project comes with a dev-container definition which bootstraps the whole
system when developing using dev-containers.
